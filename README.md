It is time-consuming and prone to mistakes to capture and organize handwritten whiteboard
content from lectures and meetings. It takes a lot of effort and frequently results in
information loss and formatting errors when notes, diagrams, and equations are manually
converted into digital slides. An AI-powered system that can automatically extract, format,
and arrange handwritten material into well-structured, polished presentation slides is
required to maintain readability and clarity while enhancing accessibility.
